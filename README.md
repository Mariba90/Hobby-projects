# Hobby-projects
Here, in this repository, you will see my projects I do for entertainment.

* B2B Analytics: a very profound time historical analysis on B2B vendor data 

* LinearRegressionPractice include predictiing huose prices using simple linear regression, feature engineering, multi variable linear regression, Ridge, Lasso. Finding the weights from scratch using Gradient Descent and Coordinate Descent methods.


* Music Recognition: bulding a composer classifier from midi files on Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert. Preprocessing notebook includes reading .midi files, cleaning and feature engineering, i.e., making the data readable for the computer and ready for the machine learning algorithms. Classifier notebook includes classifier algorithms that have been implmeneted and evaluated include SVM, XGBoost, logistic regression, KNN, Random Forest, MLP : link to the data files https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1weHPqfeWiSdufYLctmf-QpllPXuCCUP0?usp=sharing


* AnomalyDetection: finding an abnormal image among other images using SVM, AutoEncoder, KNN, PCA, etc..using PyOD package

* Fitbit_API: accessing your fitbit data

* Eclipse_photo: reading eclipse photos I took with Nikon D5600, crop the images to adjust them in the same frame, add images to gether to see the eclipse over time
